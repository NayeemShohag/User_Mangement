# Required change in *application.yml* file
Please change the username and password of database server, also change the datasource connection url. I have used database name as **bitmascottestdb**. You can create the database as this name or import the database that I have attached in **Database Backup** folder. **If you only create new database, application will create the necessary tables.**
